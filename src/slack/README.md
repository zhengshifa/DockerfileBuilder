### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "T01234567"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID",
        "mcp/slack"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "T01234567"

  }
}

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission errors, verify that:
1. All required scopes are added to your Slack app
2. The app is properly installed to your workspace
3. The tokens and workspace ID are correctly copied to your configuration
4. The app has been added to the channels it needs to access
